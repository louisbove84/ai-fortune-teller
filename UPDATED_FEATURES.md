    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí PREMIUM: Kaggle + OpenAI ‚Üí LLM generates advice ‚Üí Return insights
```

## Quick Setup

### 1. Run Setup Script

```bash
./setup_python.sh
```

This installs all Python dependencies and creates a virtual environment.

### 2. Get API Keys

**Kaggle** (Required for both tiers):
- Visit: https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account
- Create API token ‚Üí downloads `kaggle.json`
- Place in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

**OpenAI** (Required only for premium):
- Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create key ‚Üí starts with `sk-...`
- Add to `.env`: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`

### 3. Update .env

```bash
# Python Backend
PYTHON_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# OpenAI (Premium only)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here

# Kaggle (Optional - can also use ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json)
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_key
```

### 4. Start Both Servers

**Terminal 1** (Python Backend):
```bash
source apps/web/venv_fortune/bin/activate
python apps/web/python/api_server.py
```

**Terminal 2** (Next.js):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: **http://localhost:3000**

## Testing

### Test Free Tier (No API Keys Needed)

The Python backend includes fallback data if Kaggle download fails, so you can test immediately:

```bash
# Start Python server
python apps/web/python/api_server.py

# In another terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/fortune/free \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"developer","experience":"mid-career","skills":["programming"],"industry":"tech","age":"26-35"}'
```

### Test Premium Tier (Requires OpenAI Key)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python apps/web/python/api_server.py

# Test endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/fortune/premium \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"developer","experience":"mid-career","skills":["programming","ml"],"industry":"tech","age":"26-35","address":"0x123"}'
```

## Deployment

See [docs/PYTHON_BACKEND_SETUP.md](docs/PYTHON_BACKEND_SETUP.md) for full deployment guide.

**Quick options**:
- **Railway**: Deploy Python backend in 5 minutes
- **Render**: Free tier available

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to connect to fortune calculation service"

**Solution**: Start Python server first:
```bash
python apps/web/python/api_server.py
```

### "Premium features unavailable"

**Solution**: Add OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

### "Could not find kaggle credentials"

2. Or set env vars: `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY`

## What's Next?

Potential enhancements:
- [ ] DALL-E integration for actual NFT image generation
- [ ] Multiple LLM models (Claude, Gemini) as alternatives
- [ ] More datasets (LinkedIn, Indeed job postings)
- [ ] Historical tracking (re-quiz after 6 months, show progress)
- [ ] Social features (compare scores anonymously)
